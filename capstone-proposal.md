Name of Project:

PartyBox

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

Allow for users to either host a room or join a room through a unique generated code. In this room, users can vote to choose a specific game out of multiple entries, and play along in real time on the same shared screen. Based on the game type, users will be able to create a temporary profile with a score based tracking system. 

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

Have a room class which utilizes web sockets and allows for multiple people to send requests to the room and visualize changes.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

React for frontend development.
Python for backend development, specifically through flask.
Socket.io through javascript.
Flask-SocketIO library through flask.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

Once I have a room allowing for multiple people to send requests through, I will apply these features

- Make a code uniquely generated for each host room, and allow users to join rooms based on that code
- Have music/sound generated based on game selection
- Allow users to create a profile 
- Create a first basic game that lets all users interact
- have a lobby system for the shared room


What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- Howler for music
-
